  abstract = {Present Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) offers expensive models which are hard to implement in Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) due to budget limitations. Moreover, current ERP systems are associated with several issues such as mutual synchronization of multi-typed resources, limited customization, bulky upgrading cost, solution integration, industry functionality, backup hedge and technology updates. These issues render ERP systems implementation painful, complex and time consuming and generate the necessity of a massive change in ERP framework to enhance ERP systems infrastructure and functionality. Cloud Computing (CC) platforms possess the ability to overcome ERP systems discrepancies with cost-effective, customized and highly available computing resources. The goal of this research is to merge ERP and CC benefits together to reduce the factor of expenditure cost and implementation delays through a proposed framework. For this purpose, we firstly analyze the prominent issues in current ERP systems through a comprehensive comparison between ERP before and after moving to CC environment. Secondly, we propose a generic framework for “Cloud-based ERP systems” in favour of SME. The proposed framework follows multi-instance based cloud infrastructure that initiates different ERP instances for different industries. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed framework is tested through the study of the ERP system in “Awal” Company.},

  abstract = {The emergence of cloud computing has both architectural and financial implications for on-premise ERP systems. ERP designed for and running in the cloud claim to be suitable for digital business environments. However, the cloud ERP adoption literature mostly refers to small and medium enterprises, since large enterprises are constrained by investment in existing resources, and rarely presents the complex stages of decisionmaking. The context of developing vs developed countries might also vary, given the variance and rate of internal and external environmental turbulence. This case study explores the contributing factors for the initiation stage of migration from on-premise to cloud ERP by a large organisation in a developing country. In-depth interviews with key IT decision makers were analysed and a combination of internal and external factors were identified. The findings have implications for IT decision makers as well as IT innovation researchers, interested in the complexity of the transition decision.},

  abstract = {Selecting the appropriate cloud services and cloud providers according to the cloud user’s requirements is becoming a complex task, as the number of cloud providers increases. Cloud providers offer similar kinds of cloud services, but they are different in terms of quality of service; performance, cost, security, privacy, etc.  The most challenging issue of the current cloud computing business is that cloud providers offer services that vary in terms of performance quality and cost, to cloud users, but there is little or no verification models to measure performance and cost of services provided by cloud service providers. In the current literature, there is a lack of models in terms of classification of cloud services depending on the quality of performance and cost together. The objective of this research is to propose performance and cost based model for cloud software as a service selection to help users choose the best service they need. Finally, Service measurement index cloud Toolkit has been used to test the applicability of the proposed model. Results obtained from case study data containing three SaaS service providers are Google, Microsoft office365 and Amazon EC2 are visualized in an ordered SaaS service according performance and cost, showing the services in a decreasing ordering of service quality. In this way, the proposed performance and cost based model for cloud SaaS service selection represents a model capable of choosing services for cloud service users from cloud service providers.},

The question is then if, and if so, when do open source ERP systems take off. The paper describes the status of open source ERP systems. Based on literature review of ERP system selection criteria based on Web of Science articles, it discusses reported reasons for choosing open source or proprietary ERP systems. Last but not least, the article presents some conclusions that could act as input for future research. The paper aims at building up a foundation for the basic question: What are the reasons for an organization to adopt open source ERP systems.},
